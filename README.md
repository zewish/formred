## FormRed

The ergonomic React/Redux form library

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install --save formred
```

FormRed has been tested with **React 15.4+ and React-Redux 5.0+**.

It may or may not work on older versions of React and/or React-Redux, but compatibility can't be guaranteed.

The following builds are available:

* ./lib/ -> a commonjs build;
* ./es/ -> an ES modules build. Useful if you want to do tree-shaking in your build;
* ./dist/ -> a UMD build which exports `FormRed` global. Can be used for demo purposes with the UMD builds of React, Redux and React-Redux.
